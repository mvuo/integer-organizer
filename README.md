# Integer Organizer
> randomly obtains 200 numbers between 15-50 (inclusive) and displays it in the form of an array. Will sort all the numbers from lowest to highest using a bubble sort. Displays the median as well as counting the number of times each number between 15-50 (inclusive) appears in the array.

## General Information
- The parameters of the project will depend on the global variables ARRAYSIZE, LO, and HI. Arraysize is set to default 200 and will change the number of random integers initially added to the array. LO and HI are the bounds of numbers that are generated into the array.
- The purpose of this project is to reinforce concepts related to usage of the runtime stack, proper modularization practices, use of STDCALL calling conventions, use of arrays in x86 assembly language, and Indirect Operands addressing modes (CLO 3, 4, 5)


## Technologies Used
- N/A


## Features
- Generates and displays an array of random integers. The size will depend on ARRAYSIZE global variable and the bounds will depend on LO and HI global variables (inclusive).
- Sorts the array generated using bubble sort and displays the sorted array.
- Finds the median value of the array.
- Counts the number of times each number between LO and HI global variables appears in the random array. This values are put into another array and displayed.
